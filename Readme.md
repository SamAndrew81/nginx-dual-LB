 #### How to use :
 - To launch the APP, just open a terminal, go inside the unzipped folder, at the same level with docker-compose.yml, and execute : docker-compose up -d
 - This will spin up the dockerised architecture. After that, you need to open a browser and tape : http://localhost:8080
 - It will redirect 50% traffic to app1 and 50% traffic to app2.
